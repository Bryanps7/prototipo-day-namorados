            <p>My dear Gustavo, read this with your heart.</p>
            <p>Loving you from a distance, as I always tell you, won’t be easy. It’s going to be really hard. And we’ll</p>
            <p>have to fight for this every single day.</p>
            <p>But I want to do it because I want you. I want all of you. Forever. Every day.</p>
            <p>I miss you more with every moment that passes. Talking to you is one of the best parts of my day — always</p>
            <p>waiting to hear each new thing you have to share.</p>
            <p>And I truly hope that, in this journey of yours, you accomplish all your dreams.</p>
            <p>I’ll always be rooting for you, no matter what.</p>
            <p>I love loving you, and I love the feeling you awaken in me.</p>
            <p>This is just a small reminder that I love you — and that I miss you.</p>
